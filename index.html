    <h1>My wonderful Mom!</h1>

    <h1>Mom's routine</h1>
      <p>
        My mom is amazing, she's like a superhuman! On weekdays she wakes up at 5 am to catch the train to work!
        She works all the way in Boston at MGH, Massachusetts General Hospital as a service coordinater.
      </p>
      <p>
    She is currently 40 years old but you can't tell because she looks so young! Another fun fact about my mom is that she and my
    birthday are just 3 days apart! Cool, huh?
    <h2>My mom's cooking abilities...Yum!</h2>
    <p>My mom's cooking is like nothing you've ever seen, she has got to be one of the best cooks in the world.
     She makes delicious dishes, these include; waakye, jollof, meat pie, and so much more :)
    </p>
    <h3>Sleep...Ahhh!</h3>
    <p>
    I wouldn't say my mom is a heavy sleeper, she's somewhere in between! On weekends she sleeps for a while,
    she can sleep up until 11 am or beyond</p>
    <h2>Splish! Splash!</h2>
    <p>My family and I love going to the YMCA. When we do its so funny to see my mom try butterfly stroke! Hahaha!!!
    </p>

    <h1>My cool Dad!</h1>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Dad's routine</h1>
      <p>
Usually on weeekdays my dad stays home and works because he doesn't have to go to site,
going to site means actually going to work, getting on the train and going to work. I like it when he works from home because
when I get home then I can see him. He goes to site on Wednesdays!
</p>
<p>
Those days are sometimes a handful, getting Elikem to do what I want him to do or listening to me in general! But on weekends
he's usually the first to wake up! Currently he and I are taking a Harvard Web programming with Python and Javascript course.
It's really fun! :) ;)
</p>
<h2>Times when Dad is really funny!</h2>
<p>
Dad can be so funny whenever he says the same phrase over and over again to annoy mom: 'You see, I don't eat!' It's so funny,
it makes me laugh. I call my Dad, 'Didi' because when I was younger I couldn't say, 'Dad' or 'Daddy' so I'd call him Didi.
It basically became my nickname for him. These days I call him that every once in a while! :) It has become a trademark
so I don't allow my younger brother to say it. As you may have guessed he usually does say it to annoy me! :|
